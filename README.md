					**Tools & Middleware**

The following will explain the process I followed in order to prove understanding of concepts such as hinge and spring constraints, collision callbacks and retrieving and using information by reading external files. The filepath and the youtube video demonstration of my work will be found below in the end of this document.

First, an explanation of the above concepts. Hinge and spring constrains are very commonly used in game development as they serve for applying boundaries that make the game in most cases more realistic. The hinge constraint constrains rigid bodies along a specific axis by a hinge. It is commonly used to create effects such as a door on a hinge, a clock turning its pointers, wheels of cars and many more. Limitations may be created according to the force applied on these objects. For example a door that opens by hand may not break the hinge constraint, but a grenade on the door may. Spring constraints simulate an elastic cord. A common example of a spring constrain would be the bungee-jumping rope, expands and returns depending on the other forces. Collision callbacks exist when two or more objects with physics parameters collide. Usually they both have rigid bodies, but it is not necessary. For example when shooting a wall, the bullet may have a rigidbody but the wall may not, but still a collision will occur. When the collision occurs we call up the parameters and conditions we have set up to create what we wish. Therefore shooting the wall could result in the wall exploding or the bullet being deflected, it’s up to us. 

Throughout this project, although I studied and comprehended such physics properties and many more, I was not able to create the project with octet. Although I looked for paths back and forth reading and attempting to understand the bullet physics inside octet, I was not able to create my own code in order to apply the constraints and detect the collisions between the objects. I spent truly too much time trying to achieve this, but even by downloading and viewing similar examples that exist in bullet library and searching for online documentation for assistance I wasn’t able to achieve the results I wanted. Therefore I built the project in Unity which likewise has its own physic, yet however the concepts required in the project are the same. To begin with, as it can be seen in the video, the game has several event that occur in the same time. At the very front right, we can see something like a wrecking ball composed of a box, four capsules and a sphere. All of them have a rigidbody, but only the box (top one) has limitations that will keep it in place and not fall due to gravity. The rest of the objects have spring constraints linked to their above object. Therefore each object is hanging from its above one. On the bottom middle-right of the screen we have a thin cube which has on it applies a hinge constraint. The constraint is found at the center of the object and is across the x axis. Therefore when it is hit by another object it will ‘rotate’around without leaving its current position. On the left we have several simple boxes which have box colliders and from above there is a sphere with a rigid body falling onto them. When the sphere collides with the boxes, the script on the sphere is called which makes the box be destroyed. When all boxes are destroyed the sphere will roll on the floor and collide with another box which will trigger another sphere to fall from the sky. When the new sphere falls and collides with the gold box on the ground its script is triggered and it applies a rigid body on the camera which in turn falls. The camera which has a sphere collider and an extra physics body that I created for extra “bounciness” will bounce on the ground and fall on another object which will trigger a timer that will lead to the end of the demonstration and to the spite (text) pop up. Finally on the left hand side is a sphere which has a spring constrain and due to its position it is trapped between to spheres and appears to be floating, never falling down. Furthermore I implemented a script to ‘wrecking ball’ sphere which reads and prints the string in the text file readMe.txt, therefore enabling a counter to understand how many times it will collide with other objects.

The process I followed to get these results. As mentioned above I did not start with Unity but with octet. First I went to implement FMOD in example_shapes.h. After much struggle I created the appropriate (I believe) code to create music via FMOD but have constantly execution problems no matter how I switch things around. All files are there, but I believe that I was not able to succeed due to some file error and have therefore commented out anything relating to FMOD. Later on I tried to understand the given code in example_shapes.h and followed all the linked files such as mesh_sphere.h and btCollisionShape. I tried to understand the code in btHingeConstraint.h and such but was not able to add constrains, and the same applied to collision callbacks. Likewise I researched but found that bulletGL does not have the most user friendly documentation or tutorials and did not find it helpful. After much time spent trying to connect the dots unsuccessfully, I proceeded and successfully made a well laid out project in unity. Again I started with research before implementing anything, and smoothly and progressively built up on the project, starting from spring constraints, moving to hinge constraints, creating the read and write script, and finally creating all the collision triggered events in the game.

The game is found in the .zip folder containing both .exe and in the assets folder all scripts and runnables.
